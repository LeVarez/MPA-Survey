# 1. Introduction
The Earth’s climate is changing at an increasingly rapid rate, and ominously, most predictions suggest that worse is to come. As the world’s oceans are increasingly impacted by climate change, marine protected areas (MPAs), as well as the habitats and species they protect, are also becoming more vulnerable. 

The implications of climate-induced changes for MPAs are many. Ecological disturbances include: 
* Warming seas (leading to coral bleaching, ice melt, mass mortality, sea-level rise, changes to life-cycle events, etc.)
* Changes in water chemistry (e.g., salinity changes, increasing ocean acidification, reduced calcification, deoxygenation) 
* Changing oceanic circulation patterns 
* Increasing severity of extreme weather events (e.g., storm surge, cyclones) (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2014; Poloczanska et al., 2016; Pörtner et al., 2014). 

The implications for biodiversity are also far-reaching, including changes in: 
* Migratory patterns
* Species abundance and/or community composition 
* Ecosystem functioning
* Life-cycle stages of various species (e.g., turtle nesting, seabird breeding) (e.g., [Schumann et al., ](https://www.publish.csiro.au/zo/ZO12131); [Fuentes et al., 2010](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aqc.1088); [Pandori & Sorte, 2019](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/oik.05886)). 

However, MPAs are more than just biodiversity. A wide range of industries (e.g., tourism, recreation, fishing, shipping, aquaculture, research) operate within MPAs and most of these depend on healthy marine environments. Cultural heritage values (both tangible and intangible) in MPAs are also suffering from climate change (ICOMOS, 2019; UNESCO, 2007). In addition to the intangible biodiversity and heritage losses, the potential economic, social and cultural costs are immense. 

Given these risks, MPA practitioners need to play a role to help lessen the impacts of climate change. This chapter will provide:

* An overview of the range of impacts of climate change on oceans and MPAs. Although MPAs currently comprise less than 8 per cent of the world’s oceans, it’s essential to understand the broader ocean context in which MPAs exist, and the predicted future.
* Guidance on management actions and adaptation strategies to increase resilience, minimizing projected climate change impacts on MPAs as well as the communities and industries associated with them.
* Considerations for designing, or re-designing, MPAs or networks of MPAs to help diminish the impacts of climate change. 

No set formula exists to guide MPA practitioners as we face the challenges of climate change. Each MPA will require a different approach, based on its values, needs, interests, objectives, and associated institutions and communities. 

# 2. Background 
## 2.1. The global context 
The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has identified climate change as the fastest growing global threat to all protected areas, including MPAs. The range of specific impacts affecting marine and coastal ecosystems are discussed in detail by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its *Special Report on the Oceans and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate* ([SROCC](https://www.ipcc.ch/srocc/)) (IPCC, 2019). 

Some widely accepted indications of the varying impacts of climate change include:
* An increase in global mean sea levels of around 25cm since 1880, with the rise continuing at an accelerating rate, up to metres of rise over coming centuries (CSIRO & BOM, 2020).
* A rapid increase in the global ocean heat content since the 1950s. 
* A dramatic decrease of sea ice extent in the northern hemisphere (Lindsey & Scott, 2020).
* An increase in the frequency, persistence and frequency of warm episodes of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events since the mid-1970s, compared with the previous 100 years.

MPAs currently comprise around 7.7 per cent of the world’s oceans (MCI, 2021). Even if the current proposal to protect 30 per cent of the global ocean in fully and highly protected areas by 2030 is realized, and assuming all those MPAs are well managed and “climate-ready”, the remaining 70 per cent of the ocean will still be subject to a wide range of pressures including climate change. Given the fluid nature of our oceans, the encompassing context in which all our MPAs exist may therefore not be conducive to supporting healthy and sustainable MPAs. Consequently, concurrent actions for waters outside MPAs are also necessary if MPAs are to be sustained over the longer term.

Experts believe there is still time to avoid the most negative outcomes by reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and limiting global warming (Laffoley & Baxter, 2016). Reducing GHG emissions requires far greater political commitment than is currently being shown (see Section 6.1). It will also require investment in new technologies and infrastructure, though investments in reducing GHG emissions are predicted to bring long-term financial benefits (see Section 3.2.1).

## 2.2 Regional differences 

Climate impacts vary in different parts of the world’s oceans. Many publications document impacts for specific regions, along with the level of confidence about the predictions; including:

* **UK** * Marine Climate Change Impacts Partnership – [2020 Report Card(http://www.mccip.org.uk/impacts-report-cards/full-report-cards/2020/)]
* **Australia** * State of the Climate (CSIRO & BOM, 2020) – [2020 Report(http://www.bom.gov.au/state-of-the-climate/)]
* **Europe** * National climate change vulnerability and risk assessments * [2018](https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/national-climate-change-vulnerability-2018) Report
* **USA** * Climate Change Impacts * [2014 National Climate Assessment](https://data.globalchange.gov/report/nca3)
* **The Pacific** * Climate Change in the Pacific: Scientific Assessment & New Research * Vol. 1: [Regional Overview](https://www.pacificclimatechangescience.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Climate-Change-in-the-Pacific.-Scientific-Assessment-and-New-Research-Volume-1.-Regional-Overview.pdf); Vol 2: [Country Reports](https://www.pacificclimatechangescience.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Volume-2-country-reports.pdf).

For example, projections for Australia include (Hobday & Lough, 2011): 
* Hot days will become more frequent and hotter (very high confidence)
* Sea levels will rise (very high confidence)
* Oceans will become more acidic (very high confidence)
* Extreme rainfall events will become more intense (high confidence)
* Tropical cyclones may occur less often but become more intense (medium confidence).
 
Not all climate stressors will impact every marine species or habitat the same way. Some species can acclimatize, and some populations may adapt. While many marine organisms are already being adversely impacted by climate change (e.g., corals, see Box 1 below), some species are expected to benefit (e.g., some sharks and jellyfish are predicted to have increased distributions due to climate change).

## 2.3. Synergistic impacts

Synergistic or combined impacts of multiple climate stressors are expected to be greater than the impacts of individual stressors for our MPAs. Recent research has revealed some of the complexities associated with a combination of multiple stressors leading to significant impacts (Zscheischler et al., 2018). Traditional risk assessment methods typically only consider one climate stressor and/or hazard at a time, potentially leading to an underestimation of the risk, as the processes that cause extreme events often interact and are spatially and/or temporally dependent (e.g., warming decreases oxygen concentration while increasing the metabolism and oxygen demand of most fishes and invertebrates).

##### Box 1 Coral reefs and climate change

Major transformations of coral reefs globally have recently occurred due to an increasing frequency and severity of heat-induced coral bleaching events (Hughes et al., 2017) and increasing intensity of tropical storms (Cheal et al., 2017). In 2018, UNESCO’s World Heritage Centre released a global scientific assessment of the impact of climate change on 29 World Heritage-listed coral reefs (Heron et al., 2018). The report painted a dire picture, predicting that without large reductions in global GHG emissions, all 29 World Heritage reefs will “cease to exist as functioning coral reef ecosystems by the end of this century”. 

Depending on the species and habitat type, coral reefs suffering severe coral bleaching followed by mortality can take up to 9-12 years to recover (Gouezo et al., 2019). But this assumes that no new disturbances occur in the meantime (Figure 1). If the current emissions trajectory continues, within the next two decades, 25 out of the 29 World Heritage reefs will suffer severe heat stress twice a decade. This effectively means they will be unable to recover. Given that the majority of World Heritage coral reefs are far better managed than other reefs around the world, the implications of climate change for coral reefs globally are much worse.

There are physiological limits to the capacity of corals to adapt to warmer and more acidic ocean waters, so there are limits to adaptation. Combining adaptation and mitigation is essential to assure the long-term sustainability of the world’s reefs. Without strong and timely emissions reduction, iconic MPAs like the Great Barrier Reef are unlikely to survive in anything like their previous biodiverse form in the longer term.

This graphic indicates the range of threats to coral reefs and the range of impacts (note some impacts are immediate, others are long term; some are direct, while others are indirect). 

## 2.4. Nature-based management approaches 

Long-established, well-functioning and healthy MPAs are inherently more resilient to climate change impacts and can help halt biodiversity loss and soak up carbon emissions (Laffoley & Grimsditch, 2009). Management options are focusing increasingly on nature-based approaches such as conserving, restoring or better managing ecosystems to minimize climate change impacts. 

For example, efforts are underway around the world to protect and restore mangrove swamps, salt marshes, seagrass meadows and kelp forests, as well as to encourage their growth. In the UK, [Project Seagrass](https://www.projectseagrass.org/) is laying rope and seed to create new seagrass meadows and kelp is being reintroduced; the [Wallasea Island Wild Coast Initiative](https://www.rspb.org.uk/our-work/casework/cases/wallasea-island/) (Essex) is building up salt marshes using material dug out for the Crossrail tunnel in London. In Kenya, where mangrove wood is used for charcoal, shipbuilding and carpentry, conservation organizations are working on long-term mangrove restoration projects. 

Nature-based approaches are preferred over geoengineering approaches (discussed further in Box 2), but there is also a need for changes in management approaches and/or policy arrangements in adjoining areas outside MPAs, especially if the current situation limits adaptation responses. 

For example, increasing precipitation may result in greater sedimentation within the catchments adjoining a coastal MPA and that may require an increased emphasis on adjacent coastal planning. However, as Roberts et al. (2017) note, “the benefits [of nature-based approaches] are highly contingent on effective implementation and management”. 

Hoegh-Guldberg et al. (2019) suggest the ocean should also be considered as a solution to climate change, proposing five areas of ocean-based climate action: 

* Ocean-based renewable energy
* Ocean-based transport
* Coastal and marine ecosystems (e.g.., blue carbon)
* Ocean-based food (including aquaculture and shifting human diets towards seafood)
* Carbon storage in the seabed (although limited due to unknown risks). 

Laffoley & Grimsditch (2009) outline the significance of blue carbon. UNESCO (2021) has shown that marine World Heritage properties contain around 15 per cent of global blue carbon assets despite covering less than 0.57 per cent of the ocean. Blue carbon is rapidly gaining interest, so guidance for MPA managers in the assessment, protection and management of blue carbon habitats and processes is important (e.g., Hutto et al., 2021). 

There remains, however, some debate regarding the benefits of the blue carbon concept, with critics maintaining the potential mitigation effects on climate are limited. However, compared to the geoengineering proposals, nature-based approaches have been demonstrated to work and are far less risky (see Box 2 in Section 5.3). Nature-based approaches will have other positive impacts and every action helps, but the actual climate mitigation gains from such approaches are relatively small.
