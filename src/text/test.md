MPAs need to understand the local context, find opportunities through beneficiaries, address issues and challenges, and deliver dedicated marketing and communication activities in order to develop a sustainable financing strategy.

An important aspect of this is to diversify your revenue streams to ensure a sustainable income for the MPA. Relying on a diverse set of financing mechanisms (FMs) allows your MPA to depend less on specific revenue streams, funders or donors. It also provides flexibility in case revenue sources are suddenly on hold, as it occurred with tourism income streams during the pandemic.

The exact mix of diversified FMs to ensure long-lasting funding for your LLMA or MPA depends on the beneficiaries, key actors and stewards, and ecosystem services of your MPA. Depending on how they generate benefits, you can identify an often lengthy list of potential FMs for the MPA.

You can prioritize those FMs by analyzing their:
* financial impact
* ease of implementation
* likelihood of success

The sustainable finance framework below, from Wolfs Company, guides you through the funds flow analysis you should do for those priority FMs:

In pre-covid times, tourism was often the main driver of MPA financing. When the pandemic placed tourism-related streams on-hold, some sites adapted their strategies to integrate other more diverse, flexible, and predictable funding sources.

Some of the new strategies are MPAs resorting to:
* Selling their products online,
* Strengthening their crowdfunding programs,
* Establishing adopt-a-programs,
* Creating volunteering programs, Starting blue carbon projects,
* Providing services such as research.

The table below offers an overview of different sustainable FMs classified by source:

Implementing innovative FMs like those under “other mechanisms” is often a long-term process, which should be initiated at the beginning of the sustainable financing strategy, but at a very slowly pace.

After prioritizing the FMs, the next step is to apply the funds flow analysis. Since you can implement each FM differently and they may involve a variety of stakeholders, the funds flow analysis can help you assess how an FM would work for your specific case.

The Eco2Fin framework from Wolfs Company can support the in-depth assessment of the socio-economic and governance domains.

The assessment focuses on the challenges to implementing current and potential FMs. Those challenges can be administrative, environmental, political, financial, social, or legal.

The sustainable finance plan then should contain:
* a set of diverse and feasible FMs
* concrete interventions required to implement them
* and the resources needed versus the resources available — each FM requires dedication by your staff and you can only start with the next FM once resources to do so are available again

Understanding the obstacles that your proposed FM will face can help you design interventions to overcome these challenges. For example, if current legislation doesn't allow you to charge entree fees, then your intervention will be engaging lawyers and civil servants to remove legislative barriers.

The resources available to your MPA should increase over time and, provide further resources to start implementing more innovative FMs. We recommend starting with the ‘low hanging fruit’ —FMs that can be easily implemented or made more efficient. In parallel, slowly start with other more challenging FMs and increase effort when your ‘low hanging fruit’ generates income.

Between 5 to 15 FMs should be sufficient to have a sustainable finance strategy but it is crucial to leave room to adapt and anticipate changes in your context.
