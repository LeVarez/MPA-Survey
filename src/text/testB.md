# 1. Introduction
This introductory chapter explains the role and importance of sustainable financing for marine protected areas (MPAs) and provides an overview of challenges, approaches, emerging trends, persistent limitations and lessons from the field.[1] It aims to help MPA practitioners to generate funds, optimize financial management and strategically build financial sustainability.
The challenges MPAs face and relevant strategies to make progress towards financial sustainability can be highly specific to their contexts. MPAs range from locally managed marine areas (LMMAs) in coastal zones to offshore no-fishing areas or extensive marine reserves. Their establishment and operations involve a wide array of practitioners and stakeholders, including planners, managers, researchers, decision-makers and local communities.
Through this project and our previous experiences, we have come across many questions that MPA practitioners have in relation to sustainable financing in the unique context of their sites. Practical guidance on a selection of these key issues is offered by experts and practitioners in the Key questions and tools and resources sections, while lessons learned from practitioners are shared through a selection of case studies.

# 2. Background
## 2.1. Positioning MPAs in the international agenda
As the targets for the [post-2020 global biodiversity framework](https://www.cbd.int/doc/c/3064/749a/0f65ac7f9def86707f4eaefa/post2020-prep-02-01-en.pdf) of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) are discussed, 60 member countries that comprise the [High Ambition Coalition](https://www.hacfornatureandpeople.org/home) have proposed a global “30x30” target for conservation areas to cover 30% of the world’s marine and terrestrial surface by 2030 (Waldron et al., 2020). This 30% target has gained increasing support. Some leading members are taking concrete action to foster MPAs as part of wider integrated marine management and to mobilize funding to expand and effectively manage new and existing MPAs (e.g., [Forever Blue Fund](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJndcWz0LpE) in Costa Rica).
The proposed targets reflect a growing recognition of the importance MPAs in conserving marine biodiversity, ensuring sustainable human use of the oceans and protecting vital ecosystem services, including:
* Food
* Clean water
* Climate change mitigation
* Flood risk reduction
* Coastal protection
* Regulating services that support ecosystem-based adaptation.

MPAs can be effective nature-based solutions to address urgent issues, such as climate-related risks, food security and biodiversity loss.

## 2.2 Financing needs to achieve global MPA targets
Reaching the 30% target for both marine and terrestrial protected areas combined will require an estimated US$103 billion to US$192 billion annually, including protected area establishment (US$35–103 billion) and minimum operations (around US$67 billion) (Deutz et al., 2020; Waldron et al., 2020). This compares to around US$24.3 billion that is currently spent annually in marine and terrestrial protected areas worldwide (Waldron et al., 2020). Up-to-date estimates of global financing needs to reach the 30% target for MPAs are still to be refined, with previous examples most likely providing underestimated figures due to a lack of complete data. These previous estimates include, for instance, a range between US$5 billion and US$19 billion annually to establish and manage (at a minimum level) a 20-30% coverage of MPAs (Balmford et al., 2004), or a total of US$223–228 billion over a 35-year period to set up and manage 30% coverage (Brander et al., 2015).

Achieving effective management of MPAs covering 30% of the ocean will require substantial and well-coordinated global efforts to cover structural costs over the coming decade. These costs include:
* **Establishment costs**: Research, planning, outreach, training and initial capital for enforcement equipment and other infrastructure (Bohorquez et al., 2019; Davis et al., 2019; Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD, 2017; McCrea-Strub et al, 2017).
* **Operational costs**: Enforcement, research, ecosystem management and restoration, monitoring and evaluation, incident response, community development, administration, and all the corresponding costs of equipment, infrastructure, staff, legal fees and contingencies to support MPA operations (Bohorquez et al., 2019; Davis et al., 2019; Tolisano, 2021).
* **Compliance and opportunity costs**: Transaction costs that MPAs create for their users, and opportunity costs associated with economic benefits that former users of MPA ecosystems forego (Bohorquez et al., 2019; Davis et al., 2019). While fishers or other users of marine resources generally bear these costs, they could also become part of MPA operational costs (e.g., community development) as compensation to the affected groups (Bohorquez et al., 2019).

## 2.3. The role of sustainable financing
Available assessments suggest that the most substantial MPA-related costs are incurred in their regular operations (Bohorquez et al., 2019; Davis et al., 2019). The recurring nature of these costs requires capacity to anticipate future needs and financing sources and mechanisms that deliver reliable, consistent and predictable funding in the long term.

Unfortunately, many MPA managers face challenges to keep track of their needs, implement long-term strategies and/or diversify their financing sources and mechanisms. As a result, they face a strong dependency on short-term, restricted or piecemeal funding.

## 2.4. The enabling environment
Essential conditions for MPA management entities to build sustainable financing include:
* **A governance framework** that allows funds to be raised and used for MPA management
* **Management instruments** (e.g., management plans) to guide MPA operations and application of funding
* **Management capacity** (e.g., staff, processes and systems) that enables MPA operations.
* **MPA leaders and champions** who create a favourable environment for effective decision-making, collaboration, resource mobilization and efficient use of funds.

A number of external enabling factors may also determine the success of MPA financing efforts:
* **Favourable legal framework and political environment**: Legislation may regulate issues such as property rights and compensation for opportunity costs, allow specific financing mechanisms, enable revenue collection (e.g., from fees, fines, taxes, etc.), and facilitate private investments, among other aspects. The political environment may in turn facilitate the use of policy instruments or the required legislative changes to generate funds (e.g., by changing fee levels, promoting investments, endorsing partnerships, etc.) or to improve cost-effectiveness.

* **Integration with economic development**: Recognition of the benefits MPAs provide to local communities (e.g., preserving cultural practices or livelihoods), key economic sectors (e.g., fisheries, tourism and transportation), or the global community (e.g., research, habitat for migratory species and climate change mitigation) is fundamental to mobilize efforts towards sustainable financing of MPAs. Positioning MPAs as tools for sustainable economic development (e.g., as nature-based solutions or pillars of a sustainable blue economy) in national, regional or international policy frameworks and political agendas can also enable new financing streams.
* **Access to data and know-how**: Ecological and socioeconomic data on the MPA and its context can create transparency and improve exchange and collaboration with governments, donors or partners. Technology (e.g., open-source, free or affordable tools and databases) and digital connectivity can facilitate the gathering, use and communication of relevant data. External capacity building opportunities can help optimize all these efforts.
* **Access to intermediaries and facilitators**: External advisors, facilitators and networking platforms can play critical roles in connecting MPA management entities with experts, donors or potential partners in a cost-effective manner.

# 3. Challenges
Although increasing global connectivity has made plenty of resources accessible (e.g., digital reports, webinars, websites and other online platforms) to support MPA financing efforts, success stories from MPA sites still seem to emerge at a slow pace. “There are many financing mechanisms out there, but none of them works on its own,” says Ramón de León, who managed the Bonaire National Marine Park for more than a decade and currently runs [Reef Support](https://marineparkfee.com/), an online payment platform he designed specifically to help MPAs optimize their fee systems. “While a combination of mechanisms and strategies may work best, MPAs still face many challenges to successfully implement them.”

The challenges De León mentions can relate to highly context-specific factors, such as the type of management entity, its capacities, the administrative or financial requirements of some mechanisms, the MPA geography, the natural resource base, socioeconomic conditions around the MPA, or the legal and political system, among others.

Below, we present a selection of persistent challenges we have identified through our work on sustainable financing strategies with MPAs in Latin America and the Caribbean, and workshop inputs from international MPA practitioners.
## 3.1 Administrative and financial challenges

The time, technology, infrastructure and management processes required to improve financial health and build sustainable financing can pose administrative and financial challenges. In particular, this can include:

* **Technical capacity**: Limited staff capacity, financial literacy and relevant in-house skills are commonly observed among relevant organizations for MPA financing and management as a result of insufficient budgets or broader socioeconomic challenges. Limited capacity often causes an excessive workload for MPA management staff, which affects their ability to invest time in MPA financing. As a consequence, MPA managers may struggle to develop multiannual and programme-oriented budgets, identify and implement cost-effectiveness measures, develop or follow up on management and strategic plans, optimize management processes, and achieve relevant cross-sector arrangements, among others.
 
* **Planning instruments**: Unclear or inadequate management planning may lead to ineffective use of funds, create unnecessary transaction costs, limit the use of specific financing mechanisms (e.g., user fees) or hamper the development and maintenance of infrastructure (e.g., buoy and mooring lines, tourism-related infrastructure, research facilities, etc.) for fund generation, among others.

* **Compliance**: The aspects mentioned above, and the absence of proper administrative procedures, can also cause difficulties for the MPA to comply with administrative and financial requirements that need to be met to access specific types of finance (e.g., from private investors or financial institutions). It can be a challenge to meet basic reporting or risk-profile requirements, or to develop projects that generate the expected financial or non-financial outcomes. The knowledge, skills, assistance or processes required for MPAs to identify, design, implement, monitor and assess financing mechanisms (e.g., blue carbon projects, concessions, tourism-related fees, etc.) can also pose challenges to diversification of financing options.

* **Adoption and use of technology**: The lack of relevant capacities and limited funding can prevent MPAs from adapting and using technological tools. Particularly in remote areas, access to new technologies can be strongly limited because of poor internet connectivity or higher implementation costs (e.g., shipping, subscriptions, infrastructure, etc.).
