## 3.2. Social and economic challenges
The MPA’s social and economic environment can also create challenges:
* Stakeholder engagement: Implementing financing mechanisms in an MPA usually requires local stakeholders (e.g., sectors, institutions, communities or individuals) to transform processes and activities. Stakeholders may not be prepared to engage or adapt without a compelling case that illustrates the socioeconomic, financial and ecological benefits or an equitable benefit-sharing structure that gives them an incentive to support the adoption of a financing mechanism. MPAs may also need to overcome negative perceptions or mistrust of the management entity, and the (cultural) attachment of stakeholders to incumbent processes and activities.
* Attraction and retention of key staff: In some contexts, such as in small island developing states, high staff turnover can be a result of political changes, migration trends or the inability of the conservation sector to offer competitive career development opportunities, or competitive salaries and compensation for working in remote locations. This can make it difficult to develop and maintain a consistent level of staff capacity (technical, managerial, executive, etc.) to provide continuity of administrative and financial processes. Expertise related to sustainable financing is also in demand by the private sector, development banks, UN agencies and NGOs – and is therefore especially hard to retain. The difficulties to attract and retain key staff have cross-cutting implications and can create or exacerbate, for example, administrative challenges.
* Economic swings: The Covid-19 pandemic has emphasized how global trends can greatly affect local economies and the MPAs that financially depend on them. Depending on financing sources that are closely linked to specific economic sectors (e.g., tourism) makes MPAs vulnerable to economic trends outside the control of the site itself.

## 3.3. Legal and political challenges
Legal challenges can relate to specific rules that hamper MPA financing efforts. Political challenges may emerge from stakeholder interactions and policy implementation.
* **Limited awareness and support**: Decision-makers and budget-holders may lack awareness of the benefits of MPAs. This can translate into insufficient or variable political will, which can in turn affect:
    * Support for the implementation of financing mechanisms such as fee systems, permits or licences
    * Funding for enforcement, particularly in the face of significant economic actors accessing resources in disregard of laws and regulations
    * Integration of MPAs with other government budget priorities (e.g., healthcare, education, social programmes, etc.) 
    
* **Legal and regulatory restrictions on fund generation**: There are legal systems in which MPA management entities are not allowed to collect or retain fees and fines (or it is unclear whether they are entitled to do so). For example, public MPA management entities might not be allowed to raise and directly manage funds outside government budget allocations. In other cases, funds collected in the MPA might go to the central government budget and not then be redistributed. Legal and regulatory restrictions on the types of financing that the MPA or its managers can raise also limit their opportunities to generate funds. 
* **Lack of influence on public budget allocations**: Government budget processes and rules can be difficult for MPA managers to navigate and limit their ability to seek increased budget allocations. In addition, MPA managers might not be involved in negotiating budgets for protected areas. 
* **Ineffective policy implementation**: Even if relevant policies and strategies are in place, the lack of guidance, slow implementation or difficult institutional and legal reforms can pose challenges to the use of financing mechanisms such as concessions or user fees.
* **Compliance and enforcement**: The lack of robust compliance and enforcement frameworks can affect overall MPA effectiveness (OECD, 2017) and the ability of relevant entities to collect fees or enforce permits and licences.
* **Property rights** : The lack of, or uncertainty about, property rights in coastal and marine areas, especially for communities or for marine conservation agreements, can prevent the use of concessions or other private sector management as approaches for MPA financing. Unclear or complex shared tenure or resource rights can, for example, create high transaction costs for specific financing mechanisms.
* **Unclear mandates**: When there are co-managers, or management is delegated by the government to a private entity, these co-managers or delegated managers usually lack sufficient funds and/or enough support to create a sufficient stream of revenues. Overlapping or conflicting enforcement mandates among agencies, or co-managers, can also affect compliance and enforcement. 
# 4. Approaches and strategies
There are different approaches and strategies to overcome challenges to sustainable financing of MPAs. In this section, we focus on three cross-cutting approaches and strategies.
## 4.1. The case for MPA financing
MPAs can generate direct market benefits such as increased commercial fish catch or increased tourism revenue; indirect market benefits such as protecting coastal infrastructure and property, and research; and non-market benefits related to the existence value of species or ecosystems (Davis et al. 2019). They act as nature-based solutions to wider societal priorities, such as:
* Food security, through healthier fisheries (Johnson et al., 2021; Sala et al., 2021)
* Economic prosperity, based on the benefits MPAs provide to different sectors of the blue economy (see Module 3 Blue economy/business planning Q&A), particularly in small island developing states and coastal nations
* Inclusive development linked to sustainable livelihoods, ecotourism and other opportunities for local actors, for example in LMMAs (Jonas et al., 2021).
* Protection against climate-related risks in locations where MPAs mitigate floods and coastal erosion, or reduce the impacts of extreme events on communities and infrastructure (Johnson et al., 2021; Sala et al., 2021; McKinnon et al., 2021).
* Climate change mitigation in sites where MPAs help prevent mangrove or seagrass degradation, supporting carbon storage and sequestration (Johnson et al., 2021).
* Protection against risks related to biodiversity loss (e.g., public health risks) and ecosystem collapse (e.g., higher exposure to floods) in areas where MPAs protect key habitats and support ecological connectivity (Johnson et al., 2021; Sala et al., 2021).

Although these benefits are usually clearly apparent for MPA practitioners and direct beneficiaries, MPAs might not necessarily be perceived as valuable by other actors (e.g., resource users facing restrictions because of an MPA, or decision-makers focused on other topics). Improving the understanding of MPA-related benefits is essential to shift negative perceptions or raise awareness among these types of actors. This can be a strategic step for MPAs to:
* Inform and promote the design of favourable policies (e.g., for benefit-sharing or fund generation) (Davis et el., 2019)
* Increase social acceptability of, and compliance with, MPA rules and financing mechanisms (e.g., user fees, entry fees, licences, etc.)
* Mobilize additional finance (e.g., philanthropic donations, government budget allocations, bilateral or multilateral cooperation, private sector finance).

Some MPAs have promoted win–win conservation alliances with local actors by building on their contributions to the local economies. Bay Island National Marine Park in Honduras, for example, offers its water monitoring services to local businesses and communities to support coral reef conservation, tourism and sanitation. Communicating these types of links between MPAs and the local economy can create wider support for the MPA and generate additional income through providing services.

Building a compelling case for MPA financing will depend on the target audience:
* Data about MPA contributions towards national targets and commitments, such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), could help mobilize political will and government funding.
* Outcome and performance indicators could help reach private sector actors.
* Information about potential market benefits could be relevant for local communities with a stake in specific financing streams (e.g., blue carbon projects or community-based tourism).

At the local level, a clear case for an MPA can also improve acceptance and compliance with MPA regulations among local MPA users, such as fishers or tour operators (Davis et al., 2019), and eventually generate additional funds through fees, licences, permits or similar. As an example, dive operators who benefit from a healthy reef managed by an MPA might be less likely to resist fee-sharing agreements if a strong case is presented to them. A convincing case of this kind will most likely include aspects such as:
* Cost-distribution (i.e., who pays for compliance, administration, monitoring, etc.)
* Monetary and non-monetary benefits (e.g., potential increase in fish biomass, increase in visitor numbers, recovery of fish populations or coral cover, etc.)
* Cost-benefit ratios (e.g., monetary benefits exceeding the costs)
* Main beneficiaries (i.e., who receives the benefits from an effectively managed MPA)
* Relevant timeframes (e.g., short-term versus longer-term costs or benefits).

At the international level, a case can be built for increased bilateral or multilateral development financing being directed towards MPAs in countries that carry a disproportionate burden when creating and managing large MPAs or MPA networks in priority sites for the global community (Sala et al., 2021).

## 4.2. Budgeting, financial planning and cost-effectiveness
Reliable data on the current and projected financial situation of an MPA is the basis of developing a sustainable financing strategy. Your budget should ideally show how available resources are allocated to different cost categories (e.g., staff, equipment, infrastructure, etc.) and management objectives, activities, programmes or functional areas (e.g., enforcement, site management, research, monitoring, etc.).

In addition to short-term budgets (e.g., annual or biannual), financial planning exercises can provide useful projections of future costs over longer periods of time. These cost projections can be built under specific scenarios that provide stakeholders or partners with a clear indication of the additional financing required to reach specific goals. A “business as usual” scenario showing projected costs under the current level of resources available is often used as the basis for estimating financing gaps. Alternative scenarios can, for example, consider:
* The costs required to guarantee a minimal level of conservation, meeting the most crucial objectives of the MPA management plan.
* The costs required to guarantee effective management. You can find useful guidance in the management plan itself or in external sources that set overall MPA effectiveness standards, such as the Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool or the criteria from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Green List Standard (see the Module on management effectiveness).

Some MPA management or financing entities may intend to operate a business or enterprise (e.g., camping or glamping, commercial laboratory services, tour packages, etc.) to generate funds. To analyse its viability and cost-effectiveness, a valuable exercise is to map out all required costs (e.g., capital investments, increased operational costs) over a period of several years, and to estimate the expected revenues. For the latter exercise, you’ll typically need to make assumptions using available data on numbers of visitors, willingness-to-pay studies or similar cases from other, comparable locations. Once estimated costs and revenue have been mapped, it becomes clearer what the potential of the financing mechanism is, what level of investment is needed and to what extent it can fill the MPA’s financing gap.

Building on budgeting and financial planning exercises, MPA practitioners can identify and adopt cost-effectiveness measures to reduce operational costs. Such measures can include:
* Co-management mandates
* Tools or technologies (e.g., payment or monitoring systems)
* Partnerships
* Outsourcing of activities
* Organizational or management adjustments
* Aligning expenditure among co-managers.
